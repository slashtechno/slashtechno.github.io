                <p>I recently bought a Samsung T7 and I was (and am) amazed. I am currently running Ubuntu and Kali Linux off of  it. In fact I am typing this on the SSD.</p>

<h2 class="align-center">Design</h2>
<p>The T7 is thin and very compact, yet it feels (and is) durable and sturdy. If you are looking to buy this SSD, I recommend the red or blue versions. </p>
<h2 class="align-center">Speed!</h2>
<p>For general use, the T7 is more then fast enough. If you are looking for a SSD to run an OS off of, I would recommend the T7. Also, it supports USB-C. This SSD (even over USB 2.0) is faster then some internal hard drives.</p>
<h2 class="align-center">Encryption</h2>
<p>With Samsung's software, you can encrypt the normal T7 with password encryption. If you spend the extra money for the Samsung T7 Touch, you can add fingerprint encryption. </p>
<h2 class="align-center">Drawbacks</h2>
<p>The only drawback that I have noticed is the cooling. Or lack of cooling. Samsung claims to have an advanced cooling solution but when I was installing Kali Linux it did heat up slightly.</p>
<h2 class="msg--info align-center">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you want a decent portable SSD, buy the Samsung T7. It is much faster then a hard drive, has encryption, is durable, and has a great design.  </p>
