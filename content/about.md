### I am slashtechno.  
I am a programmer. I started programming at a young age, and when I created my Github account, my interest in programming skyrocketed. Currently, many of my programs aim to increase quality of life by simplifying tasks. 
Above all else, I enjoy tinkering with software (and sometimes hardware.) Whether it be Linux, Windows, networking, or something else entirely, the possibilites of what can be done with computers are endless.

**Don't be evil.**
 
<!-- The first program I published on Github was [PiStaticIp](https://github.com/slashtechno/PiStaticIP). I developed PiStaticIp to make it easier to set a static IP address. My home router at this time could not successfully set a static IP for my Raspberry Pi. I learned a static IP could be forced on the client by adding one line to `/etc/dhcpcd.conf`.  
In order to know what line to append to `/etc/dhcpcd.conf`, some information such as the subnet mask, gateway IP, and client IP. To make setting a IP slightly easier, I made a short, rudimentary Python script. While there is much room for improvement, it was the first program I published to Github.  

My trend of creating programs to make a task easier continues. One of my recent programs, [gobackup-github](https://github.com/slashtechno/gobackup-github)  is my first Go project which aims to automake the process of backing up Github repositories.   -->
